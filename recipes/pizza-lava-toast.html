            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A simple toast covered with melty cheese toppings has been making the rounds on social media, but it's not just a slice of bread with some cheese melted on top. To give this toast the "lava" in its name, you actually stack two pieces of toast together to make a combination of grilled cheese and pizza toast.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Spread butter on both sides of each slice of bread and place on the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Bake, flipping once halfway through, until bread is lightly browned on both sides, about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cover the perimeter of one bread slice with half of the mozzarella cheese, leaving the middle part of the bread empty. Top with other slice of bread.</li>
                <li>Use the back of a spoon to make an indentation in the middle of the bread slices, pushing down firmly to reach the bottom slice.</li>
                <li>Add the pizza sauce to the indentation, and sprinkle half the Italian seasoning over the top.</li>
                <li>Cover with remaining ½ ounce mozzarella cheese and pepper jack, followed by jalapeño and pepperoni.</li>
                <li>Garnish with remaining Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and golden-brown, about 5 minutes. Slice in half and serve.</li>
            </ol>
